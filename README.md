sage-replay-parser-delphi
=========================

A collection of Delphi/ObjectPascal classes to parse replay files from games using the SAGE engine (CnC 3, Kane's Wrath, Red Alert 3, ...)

These classes are really old and were not meant to be publicly shared, they have not been cleaned up, and they would need some major rework to be re-used
