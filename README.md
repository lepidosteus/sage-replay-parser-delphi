sage-replay-parser-delphi
=========================

A collection of Delphi/ObjectPascal classes to parse replay files from games using the SAGE engine (CnC 3, Kane's Wrath, Red Alert 3, ...)

These classes were not meant to be publicly shared and have not been cleaned up, they probably need some rework to be re-used
